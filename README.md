# file_transfer
A simple CLI program to send files between computers on a local network.
A user will be able to choose between client or server, then send files via CLI to the endpoint.
Largely a learning project/made for fun, to familiarize with sockets (and the official python module sockets), and have a simple program to send stuff between laptop and PC.
